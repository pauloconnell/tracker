This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).






// add db

DONE pollie_db_user 

DONE: we need a page for 'create work order' which essentially just uses the same 'service' form, but instead creates a work order instead of a service record

DONE  need to be able to delete a work order => button on work order to 'convert to completed service record' which deletes the work order and saves as completed service record


DONE : save work orders, retrieve work orders, mark complete and save as service record 
DONE keep work orders seperate from service records - have state of open/completed - the api should only retrieve work orders that are open, seperate endpoint for 'completed' work orders - add in tech's name

DONE: add Zustand - 
DONE:work order store
DONE=> vehicle store

DONE: need name of vehicle saved into work order to tell which vehicle when dashboard showing list of all outstanding work orders


DONE Review props interface in vehicle
DONE Review editVehicle wrapper page?

Next:
Add loading spiner: dashboard

Refactor: CardWorkOrder to have 'priority' dropdown to allow tech to prioritize work orders

TODOD (nice to have):
remove list of vehicles from work orders and 

// ui dashboard
=> move 'record service' down and center 'dashboard'
=> same for 'add vehicle' - move down and flex align to start finish
/vehicles/
=> spread create work order, 3 buttons flex across width space even



// BUGS
-> Create work order Location: n/a isn't clickable











## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
